### $ whoami

I’m Krzysztof — you can call me Chris. I’m a **web developer** from Wrocław, Poland who knows his way around **Django**, and also sometimes does **Vue** (but can also work with other stacks).

### Open source stuff

A lot of my open source projects are on GitHub. Projects I contributed to include:

* **[Nikola](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola)**, a static site generator written in Python, which tries to be fast and support multiple input formats (including Jupyter Notebooks) (I’m the co-maintainer)
* **[PKGBUILDer](https://github.com/Kwpolska/pkgbuilder)**, an AUR helper
* **[django-expenses](https://github.com/Kwpolska/django-expenses)**, a simple yet comprehensive system for managing personal expenses, written in Django
* …and a bunch more, listed below and on the Repositories page.

### Educational content

I also write educational posts sometimes. You might be interested in:
